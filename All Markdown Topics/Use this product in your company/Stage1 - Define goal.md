# Stage1 - Define goal
This is a goal for a single solution.  You may create many solutions for your company.

## What most customers do
[Typical goals](../Typical goals)


## My company has a unique goal
Perhaps your company needs something different.  Often this means creating a new system that your company currently does not have.  
Our product can create new systems much faster than by normal programming techniques.  Let GenevaERS do most of the programing - you just tell GenevaERS what needs to be done.  
Broadly speaking, GenevaERS needs to know:  
1.  **Input files and field details** (name, length, coding, wherter a key field)
2.  **Access** required to reference data (such as using a customer key to access customer name etc.)  
3.  **Calculations** (e.g. multiply currency amount by conversion rate to get value in US dollars)
4.  **Selection criteria** on input or output (e.g. which records to process) .  
  
Once you have all these details it is easy to create a new system using our product.
