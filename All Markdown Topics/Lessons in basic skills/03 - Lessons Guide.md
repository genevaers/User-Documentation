# 03 - Lessons Guide

- [Lesson A - Simple report](Lesson A - Simple report) - Read a Sales file to create report: **Sales by customer number**.  
  While this report is not useful, this solution teaches beginner aspects of our product.  
  
- [Lesson B - Add lookup to report](Lesson B - Add lookup to report) - Modify Lesson A to read a Customer file so report is now: **Sales by Customer name**.
  
- [Lesson C - Speed the lookup](Lesson C - Speed the lookup) - Modify Lesson B to run faster.  This is the first speed technique (of many).
  
- **<u>Lesson D</u>** - Modify Lesson C to read a Product file so report is: **Sales by customer name and product name**.  
  
- **<u>Lesson E</u>** - Create a second report: **Sales by product name**.  
  
- **<u>Lesson F</u>** - Run both Lesson D and Lesson E in parallel.  This is another speed technique.
