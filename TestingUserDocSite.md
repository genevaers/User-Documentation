# Notes on testing User Documentation 

To test changes to the User Documentation you can set up a local site. You can follow the instructions at [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

The publishing source home directory is 'User-Documentation/docs'

To summarize the process, you need to install Ruby (Jekyll is a Ruby gem), Bundler (to install the gems), run 'bundle install', then start your local server with:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you have set this up previously you may need to update the GitHub Pages gem. This is also described in the above link.
